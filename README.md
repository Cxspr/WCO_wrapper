# WCO Wrapper
An unofficial app for the Watch Cartoon Online streaming network that is essentially an elaborately wrapped HTML scraper. The aim of this app is to improve the user experience of the site on mobile by implementing series progress trackers and the ability to save a series to watch later.

## App Features
* Keep track of the shows that you want to watch by adding them to your Watchlist, the shows that you add will then be accessible directly from the home screen.
* Track your progress while watching the shows you love and easily traverse to the next episode from the home screen or the episode list.
* Be notified when new episodes are released for any of the shows on your Watchlist, in order to clear the entry from the home screen you simply have to go to the episode list for that series.
* Easily find the show you're looking for with the integrated search feature.
* Browse from a variety of genres.
  * [Note that this feature is experimental and must be enabled in settings].
* Seamlessly switch between WCO domains in the event that one is down or not working for you.
  * [Once again this can be done in settings].

## Installation
In order to install the app simply download the latest APK from the releases tab and run it on your device. If you run into any issues due to security policies on the device ensure that you have `install from unknown sources` enabled somewhere in your devices settings.

## Disclaimer
This App is not officially affiliated with the WCO brand of streaming sites but rather it is simply a fan project to improve the user experience of the sites and attempt to better adapt them for mobile devices. With this in mind, please do not direct issues regarding the app towards the site admins but instead to the issues page on this repository.

## Additional Notes
The app's UI was designed primarily to look best when using dark mode so there may be inconsistancies when dark mode is not enabled.
